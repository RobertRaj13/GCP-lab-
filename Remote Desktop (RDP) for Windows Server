Test the status of Windows Startup
After a short time, the Windows Server instance will be provisioned and 
listed on the VM Instances page with a green status iconGreen Status Icon.

The server instance may not be ready to accept RDP connections, as it takes a while for all OS components to initialize.


To see whether the server instance is ready for an RDP connection, 
run the following command at your Cloud Shell terminal command line:
        gcloud compute instances get-serial-port-output instance-1

If prompted, type N and press ENTER.


RDP into the Windows Server
To set a password for logging into the RDP, run the following command in Cloud Shell. 
Be sure you replace [instance] with the VM Instance that you created,
[zone] that you defined earlier and set [username] as admin or name we like to use.
                 gcloud compute reset-windows-password [instance] --zone [zone] --user [username]
