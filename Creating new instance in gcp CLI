Instead of using the Cloud console to create a VM instance,
use the command line tool gcloud, which is pre-installed in Google Cloud Shell. 
Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment for Google Cloud loaded with all the development tools you need (gcloud, git, and others) 
and offers a persistent 5-GB home directory


In the Cloud Shell, use gcloud to create a new VM instance from the command line:
                   gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type e2-medium --zone=$ZONE

To see all the defaults, run:  
                   gcloud compute instances create --help

You can also use SSH to connect to your instance via gcloud. Make sure to add your zone, 
or omit the --zone flag if you've set the option globally: 
                             gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone=$ZONE
